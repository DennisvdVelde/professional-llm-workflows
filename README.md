# Professional LLM Workflows

This repository contains practical documentation for working professionally with Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT.

The focus is not on tools or tricks, but on:
- understanding how LLMs behave and fail
- defining realistic and responsible use cases
- writing clear and effective instructions
- working with repeatable LLM workflows
- managing quality, risk, and responsibility

The material is intended for knowledge workers who use LLMs in professional contexts and remain fully responsible for the output.

## What this repository is (and is not)

**This repository is:**
- documentation-first
- workflow-oriented
- focused on professional and responsible use
- independent of specific tools or vendors

**This repository is not:**
- a prompt collection
- a set of shortcuts or hacks
- marketing material
- a replacement for professional judgement

---

## Structure

The documentation is organised in a progressive way:

- **Foundations**  
  How LLMs work, where they fail, and why they can be convincingly wrong.

- **Use cases**  
  How to define meaningful, realistic LLM use cases based on actual work.

- **Prompting**  
  Writing instructions as a skill, not as a trick.

- **Workflows**  
  Designing repeatable, step-by-step workflows instead of relying on single prompts.

- **Quality and risk**  
  Controlling assumptions, detecting errors, and managing responsibility.

- **Borging and reuse**  
  Making LLM usage sustainable, repeatable, and scalable over time.

Templates and examples are included to support practical application.

## Who this is for

This repository is intended for:
- professionals who publish or decide under their own name
- roles where output has impact on quality, reputation, or decisions
- people who want structure, not experimentation

It is **not** intended for:
- casual experimentation
- fully automated decision-making
- using LLMs without human control

---
